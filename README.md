<h1>Welcome to my Client-Server console chat application</h1>

- <h3>BEFORE RUNNING THE APPLICATION YOU SHOULD CHANGE LOGGING LOCATION:</h3>
-   - **go to ServerApplication/Logging/Logger.cs** <br>
    - **Open this file and go to the 8th line** <br>
    - **Change the directory, e.g. "Users/Steve/Desktop"** <br>

1. Run the ***ServerApplication*** and enter your **ip address** and the **port** you want to use.
2. You'll see your hostname and port you've entered.
3. Run the ***ClientApplication***, enter your **user name** and **server's hostname** and **port** *(you can see them on server's console)*
4. That's it! After that you can run one more ***ClientApplication*** to check that everything works;
