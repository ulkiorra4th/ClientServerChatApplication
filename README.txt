	
Thanks for watching to my project

	BEFORE RUNNING THE APPLICATION YOU SHOULD CHANGE LOGGING LOCATION:
		->	go to ServerApplication/Logging/Logger.cs 
		->	Open this file and go to the 8th line
		->	Change the directory, e.g. "Users/Gates/Desktop"
		->	That's it! 

1. Run the ServerApplication and enter the port you want to use.
2. You'll see your hostname and port you've entered.
3. Run the ClientApplication, enter your user name and server's hostname and port (you can see them on server's console)
4. That's it! If you did everything correctly application will work. After that you can run one more ClientApplication to check that everything works;

Good luck!
